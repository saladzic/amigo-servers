# Idea
My idea is a VPS hosting platform (extensible to webspace, voiceserver, gameserver..) which is mainly programmed in Java and ReactJS.

# Contributon
I am open minded for any pull request and code design suggestions.

# Motivation
I study computer science and want to be able to apply my knowledge as broadly as possible. A project like this is pretty good for that.
